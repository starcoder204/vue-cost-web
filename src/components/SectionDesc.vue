            <div>Understanding Your Rebuilding Options Navigating post-wildfire reconstruction can feel
                overwhelming.
                We offer three clear paths tailored to your needs:</div>
            <br>
            <div><b>1. Traditional General Contractor & Architect:</b></div>
            <div class="construction-desc-sub-block">
                <div>Wood Structures and non fireproof construction</div>
                <div class="construction-desc-sub-header">Most likely to produce negative property equity</div>
                Compare industry-standard costs for conventional wood-frame rebuilding with our innovative,
                fire-resistant ICF (Insulated Concrete Form) construction. While wood remains common, our method
                prioritizes safety and durability in wildfire-prone areas.
            </div>
            <br>
            <div><b>2. VDC+Owner Rep Design-Build Contract: </b></div>
            <div class="construction-desc-sub-block">
                <div class="construction-desc-sub-header">Produces high positive property equity</div>
                Our recommended solution combines efficiency, cost savings, and premium quality for maximum
                property valuation. By eliminating general contractor overhead, we reinvest those funds into
                higher-grade materials and advanced planning tools like 3D virtual modeling. This approach
                reduces unexpected costs by up to 80% compared to traditional methods, while providing 24/7
                remote site monitoring and expert guidance.
