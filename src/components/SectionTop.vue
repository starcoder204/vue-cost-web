        <p><strong>Underinsurance Prevalence:</strong> Research indicates that a significant portion of
            homeowners are underinsured, <b><i>some estimates suggesting that up to 75%</i></b> of homeowners might not have
            adequate coverage to rebuild their homes after a disaster.</p>

            By front-loading the valuation analysis and using owner-representative cost controls, VDC STUDIO
            converts insurance limitations into structured equity growth â€“ a financial necessity in
            wildfire-prone luxury markets where many of the underinsured homeowners never fully recover their
            property value after disasters.
